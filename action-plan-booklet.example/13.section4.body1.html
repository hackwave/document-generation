        <p>The way the question-and-answer functionality will work is that
        multiple questions can be assigned to the same answer. This will allow a
        reduction in the work load and make the different variations still
        appear in searches.</p> 
        <p>When a new question is posted but an answer already exist for it, but
        the wording is different. The lawyer with the answering ability enabled,
        will be allowed to select from previous answers, then assign it. This
        will automatically post the previous response to the new question. There
        will also be an option to make modificaitons if desirable.</p> 
        <p>Other forums will often, make the new user feel bad for not searching
        properly, or link to a similar question, but often the user posting the
        question does not feel their question is the same.</p> 
        <p>To avoid all of this,
        we will establish strict moderation rules that do not allow posting
        responses like "search the forums", or "its answerd here, {link}". These
        types of answers will automatically be deleted, to make the forum more
        friendly and make people feel like they are being heard.</p>

        Will users be allowed to answer? 
        <subtitle>This will be your decision</subtitle> 
        </subheader> 
        <p>If you do decide to allow other forums users to answer, which we
        would encourage, we would give these posts less prominance. They would
        very clearly be marked as someone without legal expertise.</p>
        <p>The reason, we recommend that you do is that sometimes
        the questions being asked will be more broad and generic, and allowing
        other users to post responses will save you time, and allow you to crowd
        source content, making the community more lively.</p> 
        <p>This open discussion should be encouraged, and there should even be a
        section, that functions more like a traditional forum. Where people can
        post reviews about companies, or bad experiences with debt collectors,
        so that these bring in other poeple having issues with these same
        companies, and their shared stories may not just help each other, but
        also provide comfort. And you know that debt is stressful, as long as we
        cultivate an environment where shame about debt is actively rejected.

        So who moderates?
        <subtitle>All of us</subtitle> 
        </subheader> 
        <p>To begin with, we will help with moderation, and you will have ability
        to moderate as well. But as time goes on, and if we successful establish
        a community where people are actively helping each other and posting
        regularly, then we can request help from the community.</p> 
        <p>As long as the
        rules of moderation are laid out very clearly when they are added in,
        and its made clear its a volunteer position (unless you do decide to pay
        them), you can get high quality moderation from members of the community
        for free.</p>
        <p>And this is also important because it feels like the community
        is more organic and not strictly controlled by you, which can feel
        authoritarian.</p>
