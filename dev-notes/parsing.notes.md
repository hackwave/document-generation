# Parsing Development 
Parsing development requires the ability to pull all content out of PDFs, and
rebuild them as EPUBs for greater security and searchabilityl in the case the
PDFs are made up of images and not text. 

Another key thing will be classification, summarizaiton. 

For example, we need to ability to pull the key concepts out of scientific
articles; so they can be included in a knowledge base without breaking stupid
copyright laws that actively stifle progress to benefit publishing industry
draging their feet and willing to throw children in jail for so long they kil
themselves to avoid it.
