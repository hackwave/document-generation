# Should autogenerate these based off three or 4 colors. Should be able to take
# logo and just have everything be generated based on that alone preferably.
#
# Then we should have a primary and secondary for each major color that matches
# the scheme. Right now still working on how to hold the color data so there are
# options; but all the options work and follow color rules.
