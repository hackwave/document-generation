# PDF analysis and debugging.

The examples in this section are intended to be used for debugging and getting information from
PDF files.

## Examples

- [pdf_all_objects.go](pdf_all_objects.go) outputs all numbered objects decoded and sorted to assist with debugging.
- [pdf_detect_scanned.go](pdf_detect_scanned.go) checks for the signs of a scanned document.
- [pdf_get_object.go](pdf_get_object.go) retrieves and writes out a specific numbered object (decoded).
- [pdf_info.go](pdf_info.go) outputs basic info about a PDF file.
- [pdf_inspect.go](pdf_inspect.go) performs a basic inspection on a PDF file and outptus some statistics on objects present.
- [pdf_print_content_streams.go](pdf_print_content_streams.go) outputs the content streams for a specific page or all pages in a PDF file.
