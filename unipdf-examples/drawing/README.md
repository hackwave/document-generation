# Drawing on PDF
Drawing in PDF is done through vectorized operands in the content stream.
UniPDF provides functions to do this for common shapes, otherwise custom
objects can always be applied to the content stream directly.

## Examples

- [pdf_draw_line.go](pdf_draw_line.go) draws a line in a new PDF file.
