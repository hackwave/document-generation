        <p>One major feature we can provide is using the deep-dream backed
        algorithm and rich dataset auto-translation tool <a
                                                           href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a>
        provides better auto-translation than Google. We can auto-translate the
        entire site automatically to Espanol, and possibly other languages if
        your firm decides to operate in Northern California.</p>
        <p>Another key feature is that the QnA forum will support allowing 
        multiple questions to be assigned to the same answer. This will allow a
        reduction in the work load, and will allow all different variations to
        appear in searches.</p> 
        <p>When a new question is posted but an answer already exist for it, or
        an answer almost satisfies it. The account (like Lawyer) with the answering ability enabled,
        can select to copy a previous ansewr.</p>

        <p>With the copy of the previous answer, it can be posted exactly as is,
        or it can be slightly modified. Unlike what other forums may believe,
        for this situation, it is better to have as many different wording for
        the same quesitons as possible.</p> 
        <p>To ensure we get alternate questions,
        strict moderation rules disallowing posting
        responses like "search the forums", or "its answerd here, {link}" when a
        question is repaed. These alienate new users, and make them feel
        unwelcomed. </p>

        Will users be allowed to answer? 
        <subtitle>This will be your decision</subtitle> 
        </subheader> 
        <p>There are obvious benefits and downsides to either option, but we
        would encourage allowing it; but give these posts less prominance. They would
        very clearly be marked as someone without legal expertise.</p>
        <p>Our reasoning is sometimes
        the questions asked are very generic, and users can answer these just as
        well as anyone</p> 
        <p>One option is a "Legal Question" checkbox which would be exclusively
        for lawyers to response.</p> 
        <p>The QnA should also have open follow-up questions, able to be created
        by anyone.</p>
        <p>Beyond the questions there should be a portion that functions like
        reddit or a traditional forum. A place to
        post reviews, debt collector experiences, relevant 
        news, and their personal stories.</p> 
        <p>Knowing there are others fighting debt
        collectors could also provide comfort. And you know that debt is
        stressful, as long as we cultivate an environment where shame about debt
        is actively rejected.</p>

        So who moderates?
        <subtitle>All of us</subtitle> 
        </subheader> 
        <p>To begin with, we will help with moderation, and you will always have
        the ability to moderate, and be able to assign exclusively moderator
        priviledges. 
        <p>As long as the
        rules of moderation are laid out very clearly when they are added in,
        and its made clear its a volunteer position (unless you do decide to pay
        them), you can get high quality moderation from members of the community
        for free. Often people care about their selected online community, and
        consumer protection law will be seen for what it is: good for people.</p>
