        <p>Hackwave Laboratories develops software highly secure
        environments, and only communicate between members using cryptography;
        preventing spoofing and other attacks.</p> 
        <p>Using full hardware custom micro-VM based ephemeral
        compartmentalization, not containres. And when our Uruguay datacenter
        comes online we will also offer full hardware compartmentalization, with
        fully open source servers.</p>

        <p>We stand apart from other IT companies; racing to the
        finish lines, fixing bugs as they see them, or as they get exploited, or
        never.</p> 

        <p>We do not do sprints, agile, waterfall, or any other buzzwords that
        promote bad developing; and treating software enginering as a trade.
        Which we should have all learned a lesson from IBM: when you treat
        software engineering as a trade, planes literlaly fall out of the
        sky.</p> 

        <p>We go well beyond test driven development (TDD), fuzzing, and
        validating every input into any applicaiton. We always use as little
        Javascript as possible due to the ever increasing number of XSS attacks,
        and simply put we prioritize security, and other IT companies simply do
        not.</p> 

        <p>An example of this is our use of: <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)">defense-in-depth
        approach</a> in combination with our clean-room software engineering
      model. Leading to us assuming nothing is trusted, not even the user
      trusted user. Everything is an attack surface, and everything must be
      verified. We have heard statements from other companies developers, saying
      "Well, that could never happen, so we don't need this...". And that is a
      key difference, we assume there are both *known unknowns* and *uknown
      unknowns*.</p> 

        <p>Cryptography is not a buzzword for is, its a core component of
        computer science, and we use it everywhere; and encourage you to do this
        too; especially as a law firm.</p> 

        <p>We will teach you how to use cryptography, not just for sending messages
        containing secrets but the far more important use-case for encryption:
        verifying our identity, and the validity of our messages and documents.
        Every document, and every message will be signed and verifable. So you
        can absolutely be sure it came from us.</p>

        <strong><p>We do not typically provide development services, we are primarily a
          security research workers cooperative.</p>

        <p>Our primary source of income is finding exploits existing in 
        enterprise level software, that buildings of engineers who are 
        supposedly the best miss; and we do it well.</p> 

        <p>We only make exceptions for doing software development outside of our
        cooperative network, in rare circumstances.<p></strong>
