        <p>We maintain a secure development process; developing in secure
        environments, and communicating using crytographically signed
        messages. This prevents spoofing, and other attacks.</p>

        <p>We stand apart from other IT companies; racing to the
        finish lines, fixing bugs as they see them, or as they get exploited, or
        never and like Microsoft let bugs sit for more than a decade.</p> 

        <p>We don't treat software engineering as a trade, but as a science,
        whcih we feel all IT companies should have learned to do by now. With
        the lesson from Boeing outsourcing key software: when you treat
        software engineering as a trade, planes literlaly fall out of the
        sky.</p> 

        <p>We go well beyond test driven development (TDD); we fuzz, and
        validate every input, use as little Javascript as possible due, and
        our sites always support Javascript disabled. Lacking this with the
        number of XSS attacks increasing, shows a lack of understanding of the
        security problems we face. And this is now becoming incredibly rare to
        find a site that works without Javascript.</p>

        <p>Hackwave Laboratories practices <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)">defense-in-depth
        approach</a> in combination with clean-room software engineering
      model (A model for security development from the 70's developed by IBM, as
      opposed to Agile and other similar strategies commonly used now).</p>

        <p>Our developers are always determining the attack surface, and
      developing to ensure the entire attack surface is protected; and has plans
      even for when those defenses fail.</p> 


        <p>Cryptography is not a buzzword for us, its a core component of
        computer science, and advances in cryptography have been behind a lot of
        the major advances in computer science in the past decades, from
        e-commerce, to Bittorrent.</p>

        <p>A law firm should definitely know the basics of cryptography.</p>

        <p>We will teach you cryptography; not just encryption of messages
        containing secrets but more important use-case for cryptography: signing
        and validation.</p> 


        <p>Cryptography allows verifying our identity, and the validity of our messages and documents.
