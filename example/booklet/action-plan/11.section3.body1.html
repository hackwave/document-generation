      <section> 
        <p>Gather and answer questions immediately to maximize the speed at
        which the project can be launched.<p> 
        <p>Once finished, send all of these questions and answers
        to Hackwave Laboratories <a
                                   href="mailto:contact@hackwave.org">contact@hackwave.org</a> 
        </p> 
        <p>We will supply you with questions scraped from the competitor sites: Stack Overflow, and
        Reddit legal question related subreddits.</p> 
        <p>These will be in YAML document format, which is an
        easy to understand format, this will make it easier to insert them into
        the database.<p> 
        <p>Try to define broad categories as early as possible;
        these can change but defining them early helps give structure for
        development, even if it changes ater. </p>
        <p>For example, we currently recommend the following forum sections:</p> 
        <ul> 
          <li>Consumer Protection Legal Questions</li> 
          <ul> 
            <li>Debt Questions</li>
            <li>Collection Harassment Questions</li> 
            <li>Rent & Housing Questions</li> 
            <li>Online Security Breach Questions</li> 
            <li>Workplace Discrimination Questions</li> 
            <li>Misleading Marketing & Advertising Questions</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Police Misconduct & Brutality Questions</li>
          <li>General Questions</li> 
          <li>Misc Quesions</li> 
        </ul>
          
        <p>We are not at all experts, or even vaguely competent in this field;
        above was purely meant to stimulate ideas of potential sections.
        <strong>You will be required to develop the categories</strong>, and
        there can be subcategories, but we should avoid nesting deeper than
        that. And we will do our best to help you throughout this deicison
        making process.</p>

        <p>When working question questions, we want to keep to a standardized
        YAML format. When we collect questions from scraping the other sites,
        and the internet in general, we will provide them in this format, and
        you should provide your questions and answers in the following
        format.</p> 

        <p>If its not perfect, its okay, but trying to adhere to this format
        guideline will save us time.</p> 

        <p>You will receive <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML
          document</a> that looks like the below text:</p>
        <code> 
forums: 
  general: 
    debt: 
      - question: "This is the text of a question"
        answer: "And this would be the answer and it can span across
        multiple lines without issue."
      - question: "the next question?"
        answer: "the next answer" 
      - question: "and it just goes like this"
        answer: "until the next section"
    housing:
      - question: "A question about housing"
        answer: "the response"
