      <section> 
        <p>Answering questions should be done while development on the
        question-and-answer style forums is in progress to maximize the speed at
        which the project can be launched.<p> 
        <p>Once a list of questions can be generated from emails, paraphrased,
        or extrapulated from common themes, or even questions you feel would be
        a good way for you to make a point you want to make. Send all of these
        to Hackwave Laboratories <a
                                   href="mailto:contact@hackwave.org">contact@hackwave.org</a> 
        and begin answering any that you can.</p> 
        <p>Next, we will take these and combine them with the questions and
        answers scraped from the competitor sites: Stack Overflow Law, and
        Reddit legal question related subreddits.</p> 
        <p>We will supply these in a YAML document format, which is an
        intentionally easy to understand and use format for inserting data into
        a database, but still being easy to use for data entry.<p> 
        <p>As early as possible, we will also want to establish categories;
        these can change and will be flexible, but establishing them early as
        possible will give us some structure which we can model the basic site
        around.</p> 
        <p>For example, we currently recommend the following forum sections:</p> 
        <ul> 
          <li>Consumer Protection Legal Questions</li> 
          <ul> 
            <li>Debt Questions</li>
            <li>Collection Harassment Questions</li> 
            <li>Rent & Housing Questions</li> 
            <li>Banking Credit & Loans/Finance Questions</li> 
            <li>Online Security Breach Questions</li> 
            <li>Workplace Discrimination Questions</li> 
            <li>Misleading Marketing & Advertising Questions</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Police Misconduct & Brutality Questions</li>
          <li>General Questions</li> 
          <li>Misc Quesions</li> 
        </ul>
          
        <p>We are not at all experts, or even vaguely competent in this field;
        above was purely meant to stimulate ideas of potential sections.
        <strong>You will be required to develop the categories</strong>, and
        there can be subcategories, but we should avoid nesting deeper than
        that. And we will do our best to help you throughout this deicison
        making process.</p>

        <p>When working question questions, we want to keep to a standardized
        YAML format. When we collect questions from scraping the other sites,
        and the internet in general, we will provide them in this format, and
        you should provide your questions and answers in the following
        format.</p> 

        <p>If its not perfect, its okay, but trying to adhere to this format
        guideline will save us time.</p> 

        <p>You will receive <a href="https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html">YAML
          document</a> that looks like the below text:</p>
        <code> 
forums: 
  general: 
    debt: 
      - question: "This is the text of a question"
        answer: "And this would be the answer and it can span across
        multiple lines without issue."
      - question: "the next question?"
        answer: "the next answer" 
      - question: "and it just goes like this"
        answer: "until the next section"
    housing:
      - question: "A question about housing"
        answer: "the response"
