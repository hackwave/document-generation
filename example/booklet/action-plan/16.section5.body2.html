        <p>The web application could have "services" for sale, in a store-like presentation 
        where potential clients can purchase services.</p> 
        <p>Depending on how you do business, this can be either an initial
        payment. With the ability to issue the client further invoices through
        their account.</p> 
        <p>This system could also function as your point-of-sale (POS) system,
        by adding a web application and a tablet with a card reader. Or enable
        you to allow customers to pay over time, in a payment plan. There is a
        of flexibility, and we can make it suited to your needs as the forums
        grow.</p>

        <p>A full client management system, tracking all clients:<p>
        <ul> 
          <li> Potential clients, tracking messages between you and them, all in
            one place, with their contact details, and accessible when you make
            contact over the phone for example.</li> 
          <li> Active clients, tracking what has been done, what needs to be
            done, and ability to mark their case as complete and issue their
            bill or even notify them how much they won; this could be visible on
            the forums which would greaterly influence others to use your
            services (optional, and with the user's permission).</li> 
         <li>Past clients, who may become clients again, supporting a referal
           system, where they can get compensated, or at the very least you know
           how you came to know this client, which could help with small talk or
           getting in touch with the client.</li>

        <p>Start from tracking potential client leads, tracking all active
        clients and have a system to track and monitor the stage of their cases,
        and store information about previous clients after scrubbing all
        sensitive data.</p>

        Is your system impossible to hack?
        <subtitle>As scientists, we exclusively talk in probabilities
        </subheader> 

        <p>We do everything we can to reduce the attack surface, and lower the
        probability of an attack, and try to make both the attack, and obtaining
        anything useful both as low of a probability as possible. </p> 

        <p>And we do everything we can so that in the
        event of an attack, the amount of data lost is negligble as possible
        using cutting edge techniques, and approaching software development as a
        science and not a trade skill.</p>

        <p><strong>Hackwave Laboratories always takes a security first design
          and development strategy. Using <a

                                            clean-room iterative design</a>.</p> 

        <p> You won't ever hear us preaching about "agile development", or
        "waterfall", or whatever the next new fad is. We treat software
        engineering as it should be: a computer science. So no
        agile, or railfalls, or other buzzwords.</p></strong>

        <p>We write software and
          sometimes even build the hardware, for a completely secure
          computing environment.</p>
