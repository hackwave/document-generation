        <p>Beyond just forums, the web application could have a store selling
        services for sale, depending if you have a standard package.</p> 
        <p>It would not look exactly like a store, it could be an index of
        services anyone can put down an initial payment on, or it could start as a contact
        form and you send a product for the person specifically, which could
        have an initial payment.</p> 
        And of course with the ability to issue the client further invoices
        as situation changes.</p> 
        <p>Perhaps very importantly, this payment system could also function as
        your point-of-sale (POS) system.</p>
        <p>We could even make this conventional looking by adding a web application 
        and setup a tablet with a card reader. Giving it a standard POS look.</p> 

        <p>This system could even allow customers to pay over time, setting up a payment plan. There is a
        of flexibility, and we can make it suited to your needs; as the forums
        grow.</p>

        <p>But the system can very easily with the foundation of a good user
        account system that have verified information since its tied to their
        social media be a solid client management system. Tracking all the
        following:</p>
        <ul> 
          <li><strong>Potential clients</strong> tracking ongoing conversation, all in
            one place, storing all their contact details (phone, email, etc),
            and other generic notes that could be accessible in a dashboard, when you make
            contact over the phone.</li> 
          <li> <strong>Active clients</strong> tracking state of their case,
            a task list showing what needs to be done, and ability to close out
            the case and issue their
            bill or even notify them how much they won. Optionally, the amount
            won could visible on the forums which would greaterly influence others to use your
            services (optional, and with the user's permission).</li> 
          <li><strong>Past clients</strong> who may become clients again, a referal
           system, where you could compensate them but more importantly you can
           track who referred the client, which could help with small talk or
           getting in touch with the client.</li>

        <p>We do everything to reduce the attack surface, lower the
        probability attack, and obtaining

        <p><strong>Hackwave Laboratories focuses on security when desinging, and
          developing hardware and software.</strong></p>

        <p>You won't ever hear us preaching about "agile development", or
        "waterfall", or any other fad style. We treat software
        engineering as it should be: a computer science.</p>
