        <p>And we develop in ephemeral compartmentalized
          virtual machines, and we deploy to ephemeral compartmentalized virtual
        machines (or our own open source hardware, for hardware
        compartmentalization when possible, and necessary); not containers. </p> 

        <p>Unlike many other developers and companies who are racing to the
        finish line, fixing bugs as they see them, we assume nothing will work,
        and go beyond test driven development, fuzzing our software, and
        validating every input into any applicaiton.</p> 

        <p>We use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)">security
                      in depth approach</a>, for
          example, we keep all data encrypted when at rest, and never store more
          information than necessary. These are very different strategies than
          the norms. We use as little javascript as possible, do whitelist based
          filtering for XSS, and SQLi.</p> 

        <p>When other developers say, "well, an
          attack would never occur like this, or from this angle"; we assume it
        will and defend against it.</p> 

        <p>Even in the rare event, our database is
          breached, very little of the data would be usable because of our
          policy of encrypting all data at rest, and with actually secure
          cryptography algorithms.</strong></p> 

        <p>We will teach you how to use cryptography, not just for sending messages
        containing secrets but the far more important use-case for encryption:
        verifying our identity, and the validity of our messages and documents.
        Every document, and every message will be signed and verifable. So you
        can absolutely be sure it came from us.</p>

        <p>We do not typically provide development services, we are primarily a
        security research workers cooperative.</p> 

        <p>Our primary source of income is finding exploits existing in 
        enterprise level software, that buildings of engineers who are 
        supposedly the best miss; and we do it well.</p> 

        <p>For example, one of
        our founding members, of the Hackwave Laboratories workers cooperative,
        hacked a Bitcoin ATM in under 5 minutes of first
        interacting with it, resulting it giving double payouts. Responsible
        disclosure company resulted in a bug bounty reward of 20,000 USD.</p>

        <p> We
        only deviate from our primary role as security consultancy for special
        cases we feel are worth investing the time into.</p>

       <p>Using a simple service like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe
         Payments</a> you can take credit
          cards for roughly 3% fees, which overall are reasonable, and their
          system is very easy to intergrate and use.</p> 

       <p>Hackwave Laboratories is working directly with <a
                                                           href="https://developer.visa.com/">Visa
                                                           APIs</a> to try to
       implement a low level payment service, that may be an alternative in the
       future.</p>
