		<p>Either way, people who need help with consumer law issues, seeing this knowledge-base, will begin to associate your name and law firm with expertise in this field, and you can establish a place where information about this subject can be found.</p>
		<p>This allows you ensure this information is accessible, and making it conversational, ensures that it is understandable, and forums allow people who understand to help others, in a way crowd-sourcing answers reducing your workload. In addition, you are able to control the way the information is presented, for example, ensure that debt law problems are presented in a way where there is absolutely no shame present.</p> 
		<p>One key component to this idea is using OAuth2 based login system, which means that potential clients, or people wishing to ask legal question can do so without going through a complete sign-up process, involving an email confirmation. Intead, we use the login services provided by large cites people already have accounts with, such as <a href="https://github.com/markbates/goth">Facebook, Google, Twitter, and several others</a>.</p> 

		<p>Making it easy as possible to login and ask questions is important, but another important feature will be the ability to post questions pseudo-anonymously; or posting questions without the public viewing the website from being able to see their name and email but still saving that information so that questions submitted can be used as potential leads for potential business.</p>

		<p>By lowering the complexity to reach out and ask questions, and by cultivating a resource for people looking for legal help, the flow of potential clients to your site is much greater than with the conventional business-card website. And you create a system that should not just drive traffic, but should reduce answering the same question repeatedly, by making the repeatedly asked questions you receive public.</p>

		<h2 style="font-weight:100;color:#0071B6;">Building with Go</h2>
		<p>We would build the site with Go, a language that is not a scripting language. It is a language which compiles like C. Compiling results in a single executable, which is why creating a phone app is easy. Most importantly, this method is very resource efficient. Which unlike other very popular options like Javascript is resource efficient, which translates directly and significantly to lower hosting costs.</p>
