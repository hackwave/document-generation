        <p>To acheive a successful launch of a knowledge-base for consumer protection law based on an open forum; we need to launch the forums with enough questions and answers already present to drive the initial users to the forums. Without this, we have an empty forum with little reason for people to arrive at this web application; especially when already existing services like Stack Overflow's Law forum and reddit exist.</p>
        <p> If a forum was launched empty, waiting around for answers to come in would be a failure, and is a naive and amateur approach to initializing an internet forum. Because the model for a forums community is that the forums have content which drives users to view the content, that then create more content, which starts the process over again.</p>

        Where to start? 
        </subsection>
        <p>We start with the questions that you have already received by email;
        <strong>we recommend that you go through your emails and pull questions
        asked of you, but we would want to rephrase the questions to make them
      more general and more broadly applicable. This process should be started
      immediately.</strong> And once that is done, we can begin looking at the
    existing resources for legal answers, for all the questions we will need to
    properly seed the forums.</p>

        How do we compete with existing services?
        </subsection> 
        <p>We have already started writing software to pull data from resources like Stack Overflow and Reddit. We will filter for consumer protection law questions, and specifically debt law, and generate a list of questions for you to answer to seed the site.</p> 
        <p>The web application will have the ability for multiple questions have the same answer, so questions that are phrased in different ways can lead to the web application forums without requiring separate answer pages for questions that are essentially the same. This "has_many" approach, allows a single answer to have many questions associated wtih it, this will ensure that anytime someone is searching for a question that exists on a competing forum or answer site, your knowledge-base will at least be one of the results.</p> 
        <p>This will also be helpful by reducing associated workload, when new questions are added to the web application, and the question is a different phrasing of an already present question with an answer. These can simply be attached to an existing answer, and the new phrasing will help others find the answer.</p>
