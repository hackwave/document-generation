		<p>The most common online presence for a law firm, would be to build a static website; a website built primarily with the traditional HTML, and CSS. Often the only interactive component being a simple contact.</p> 
		<p>But being one of potentially tens possibly hundreds of other law firms, then your interaction with clients will be primarily limited the limited contact form, or email; so traffic will be generated primarily from word of mouth, and people in distress who are mass emailing lawyers in their region.</p> 
		<p>And this is why following marketing convention for law firm internet presence, will lead to littlei to no additional business generated.</p>

		<h2 style="font-weight:100;color:#0071B6;">Building a community</h2>

		<p>We propose, in contrast to the conventional internet presence of a law firm of a static website; build a web application, an open forum that  is presented like an interactive frequently asked questions (FAQ) portion of site. Using these forums, designed specifically with a low barrier of entry, and the ability to post psuedo-anymously under randomly generated names, that can be customized for maximum discretion, with the ultimate goal of cultivating a community around the topic of consumer protection law.</p> 
		<p>Creating a interactive FAQ-type forum, could be a nucleating point for a community, the specific style would be a modified version of  <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/">Stack Overflow: Law</a> forums.</p> 
		<p>By creating more than just a business card, but an interactive experience, which overtime can become an important knowledge-base for consumer protection law; traffic will be not just from potential clients interested in asking specific questions, but an ideally growing number of visitors will be interested in using the knowledge-base that the forums would become.</p>
		<p>As the knowledge-base and potentially the community grows, you could even decide to allow other lawyers to post answers to questions. This optional choice could reduce the amount of work you need to invest in answering questions, and have them lend assistance in growing an open knowledge base with your firm's name on it, and the people receiving answers would still be creating an account on your service.</p>
